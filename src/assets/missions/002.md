## BAD STAR

*"A simple test of your basic locomotion and recon skills, all you've gotta do is locate the HVT and escort it to the extract site. You guys should do fine."*

# Moments

- Locate HVT.
- Escort HVT to extract.
- Performance and grading will be determined by the state of the HVT on arrival, as well as reports from your teammates. Try not to bring home a scrapheap.

# Stakes

- Mission failure will result in a loss of Reserves for future operations, and a major hit to your grade.

> Four teams of students have been dropped moonside for an exercise, with no combat expected. Each team has been assigned an HVT- High value target.

> Combat is not expected, but due to the recent incident, your weapons are loaded, and a proctor squad will be nearby if you lose control of the situation.
