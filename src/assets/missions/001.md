## UNFUCK THIS HOUSE

*"Nothing says 'trial by fire' quite like fighting for your life in open space with faulty equipment and unknown foes. It seems you're getting some extra credit early."*

# Moments

- Mech-Scale Printer and Cargo Protection
- Trailblaze in open space.
- Get the fuck out.

# Stakes

- Mission failure will result in a permanent loss of expensive union tech, and slightly less importantly- Possibly your lives.

---

> Your transport ship has been hijacked, but you're armed- Your licenses have been activated early, and the mech-scale printer inside your transport has been activated.

> Get out alive, adapt on the fly, and locate a way to Swan Academy. Surely these pirates have an escape ride you can use?
