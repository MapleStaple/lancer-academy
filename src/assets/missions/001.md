> Swan Academy primarily operates as a three-year course to acquire a lancer permit, which allows you to legally be hired as a mercenary in the outer rim. 

Each year, SWAN's dedicated faculty, staff, administrators, alumni, and students come together to plan a series of commencement events that honor the achievements and bright futures of our outstanding graduates.

Commencement offers an opportunity to celebrate and reflect on the contributions of everyone in the SWAN community who has supported our students' success.
